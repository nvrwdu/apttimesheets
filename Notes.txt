** APP FUNCTIONALITY

	Testing
		Use historical timesheets from say the past month from 4 users.
		Input data. Judge app performace.

	Email dispatch notification
		Done. Emails can be dispatched using PHPMailer.

	Database schema
		Under development

	Autosearch for unit synthetic
		Look for potential solutions. JQuery seems viable.
